# CSS Responsive Webpage Project

## About the Project

This is a beginner-level HTML and CSS project created as part of my learning journey. The project showcases a responsive webpage layout using HTML5 and CSS3 features. It includes navigation bars, styled sections, and media queries to make the layout adaptable across devices.

## 🧠 What I Learned

### ✅ HTML Basics
- Page structure using elements like `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`
- Headings, paragraphs, and semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`

### ✅ CSS Fundamentals
- Styling elements using selectors, properties, and values
- Using classes and IDs to apply custom styles
- Applying colors, font styles, padding, margin, and borders

### ✅ Navigation Bar
- Creating a top navigation menu using `<nav>`
- Styling navigation links using CSS
- Adding hover effects for better user interaction

### ✅ Responsive Design
- **Media Queries** to change layout and font sizes for different screen widths (e.g., mobile and desktop)
- Flexbox/Grid (if used) for flexible content alignment
- Ensuring the webpage looks good between 0px to 400px width

### ✅ Project Folder Structure

## How to View the Project

1. Download or clone the repository
